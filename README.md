# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Neural Networks

This notebook demonstrates how to build and train a neural network for digit recognition using Tensorflow, Keras, Pandas and Numpy.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the environment, please follow these steps:

0. open terminal and cd your way to the folder containing the jupiter notebook.

1. create a virtual environment using Python's built-in venv module:

    *python -m venv venv*

2. Activate the virtual environment:

    for windows:

    *venv\Scripts\activate*

    for macOS/Linux:
    
    *source venv/bin/activate*

3. Install dependencies

    write:

    *pip install -r requirements.txt*

    The requirements.txt file includes all the necessary dependencies for the project,

If you encounter any issues with the setup, try updating pip and the installed packages:

*pip install --upgrade pip*

*pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt*

If the save_canvas_image function does not work and you can't draw on the canvas using your right click, try running the notebook on a browser or a different kernel.
You might also skip the canvas image function and draw a handwritten digit using editing software like paint. 
Save the digit image in the same folder as your notebook and specify the digit's path.
